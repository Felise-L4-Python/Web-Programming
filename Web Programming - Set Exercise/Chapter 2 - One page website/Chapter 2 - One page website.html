                <div class="plott">
                <p> The movie Frozen is about the two princesses, Elsa and Anna, from the kingdom of Arendelle. Elsa who is the eldest daughter
                    was born with magical powers that can create ice and snow, meanwhile Anna is born without any magical power. While they were
                    building a snowman and playing with the snow created by Elsa, she accidentally hits Anna in her head with her magic powers. their
                    parents quickly came as Elsa called out for help, they took her to the tribe of trolls to repair the damage. Grand Pabbie, the troll
                    leader, ask whether Elsa is born or cursed with her abilities. King Agnarr confirms that she was born with it and Grand Pabbie then
                    explains that Anna was fortunate to be hit in the head than the heart, since it would have been fatal. He advises the family to avoid
                    Elsa using her powers around Anna and then he alters Anna's memories to ensure she doesn't know about her sister's powers, only remembering
                    the fun they had together.
                </p>
                <p> Grand Pabbie warns Elsa about the dangers of her growing powers, is she cannot control them her fear will be her greatest enemy. Then the king
                    ordered to close the gates of the castle, reduced the staffs, and Elsa is ostracized from everyone, even her sister Anna, to protect her from
                    the world until she learns to control her powers. This leaves both sisters feel distraught and lonely. Years went by, the sister lose their parents
                    in a shipwreck, and Elsa must take the throne as the eldest daughter. Elsa finally come out from her isolation with anxiety from her powers and
                    orders the castle gates to be open for her coronation. Meanwhile Anna falls in love with a visiting princes, Hans, who later then asks her to marry
                    him. Elsa refuses, and the two sisters argue which caused Elsa to reveal her powers and turning the kingdom of Arendelle into a permanently Frozen
                    wilderness. From her fear of harming anyone from her powers, she runs away to the mountains and used her powers to create an ice palace. Anna decides
                    to track down her sister and convince her to reverse the spell. She then teams up with Kristoff, his reindeer Sven, and a magic snowman named Olaf to
                    face every challenges they encountered to reach Elsa. In the end, Anna and Elsa discover that true love is the solution to their problems.

            <h4>TIMES OF INDIA</h4>
            <p>"It's an incredible journey of a brave girl, who sets out to find her sister - the reluctant ice-queen with the help of an adorable snowman
                and an unconventional 'prince charming'. It is nowhere the 'clich√©d' fairy-tale, with an archaic view on women. The film introduces the new 
                age Disney princesses, who no longer wait to be rescued. They are brave, uninhibited yet vulnerable and sacrificing. While snow looms over 
                the kingdom, it's the goodness of people that keeps the fire burning. Also, Frozen redefines Disney's quintessential 'true love' theory. Even 
                if you are not into fairy-tales, you'll love this one for it's unpredictable and thus keeps you engaged throughout. It's not about seeking 
                happiness with someone else, but being happy with who you truly are." </p>

            <h4>ROTTEN TOMATOES</h4>
            <p>"Beautifully animated, smartly written, and stocked with singalong songs, Frozen adds another worthy entry to the Disney canon."</p>

            <br>

            <h4>THE IRISH TIMES</h4>
            <p>"The makers of Frozen have set themselves a serious challenge. This is one of the very few Disney animations that does not employ a full-on 
                demonic villain. In a tricky twist, Princess Elsa takes on some of those duties herself. It is, after all, she who brings chilly calamity to the 
                beautifully rendered Nordic city. But that complexity adds a new dimension to a genre that more usually thrives on familiarity and convention."</p>

            <h4>SCREENRANT</h4>
            <p>"Frozen is another fine addition to the Disney animated feature pantheon, offering a witty and heartfelt princess fairly tale with creative musical 
                elements and some visual panache. The only significant problem with the story is that there are plot/character elements that feel too much like 
                conscious attempts to "correct" the classic Disney princess fairy tale tropes; in particular, those which are now outdated." </p>
